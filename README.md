# Engineering-Inventory-Organizer

ABOUT

The engineering department of Ashesi University college officially began a few months ago. Considering the importance of the laboratories, we thought a great Software Engineering project would be to develop a web based application to make it easy to check in tools and checkout tools to students and faculty.
The funtionalities with the highest priority that this project seeks to achieve are:

1. Enable login for admin/user

2. Add a tool to the database

3. Search for a tool

4. View a tool and its details

5. Edit tool information

6. Delete a tool

By the end of this project, there should be an easier way for the engineering department to keep inventory of lab equipment.
