# Engineering-Inventory-Organizer

ABOUT

The engineering department of Ashesi University college officially began a few months ago. Considering the importance of the laboratories, we thought a great Software Engineering project would be to develop a web based application to make it easy to check in tools and checkout tools to students and faculty. Currently, our main user is the lab technician or administrator who is in charge of monitoring the system and updating it with the functionalities of the system.
The funtionalities with the highest priority that this project seeks to achieve are:

1. Enable login for admin/user: This allows a user to get into teh system using details that woudl be verified to check the details entered and provide the appropriate view

2. Add a tool to the database: This function allows our user(administrator) to add new tools to the inventory manager. A form containing certain parameters as tool_id, tool_name, description, purchase date, supplier details, manufacturer details,lab(which lab it would be available in) is provided and the administrator fills them in and clicks the submit button to add to the database

3. Search for a tool

4. View a tool and its details

5. Edit tool information: This allows you to edit the details the lab technician inputed when he was adding a tool. So it takes the changes and updates it in the database

6. Delete a tool:This functions allows the administrator to remove a tool that no longer exist in the database or is sent out for repairs. There is a button that when pressed, goes into the database to find the id of the item that has been clicked on and removes it from the database.


By the end of this project, there should be an easier way for the engineering department to keep inventory of lab equipment.
